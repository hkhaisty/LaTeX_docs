\item List the four techniques discussed to perform verification and validation?

\item List two techniques you can use to perform validation -- that is, to ensure your program meets user requirements.

\item Briefly explain the concept of static analysis, and to which software products it can be applied.

\item Briefly explain two different ways to decide when to stop testing.

\item Consider the simple case of testing 2 variables, \textit{X} and \textit{Y}, where \textit{X} must be a non-negative number, and \textit{Y} must be a number between -5 and +15. Utilizing boundary value analysis, list the test cases.

\item Describe the steps involved in a formal inspection process and the role of a moderator in this process.

\item What is the difference between performance testing and stress testing?
