    \s ection*{Review Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
    
    %DONE
    \item Explain the role of requirements in architectural design. Explain the role of requirements in detail design. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] The function and nonfunctional requirements along with the technical considerations provide most of the drive for the architecture. 
    \end{itemize}

    %DONE
    \item What does aggregation mean in OO? Give an example.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Aggregates are parts of a larger object. For example, if there is a class called \textit{Car}, then it might be comprised of objects such as \textit{engine} 
        and \textit{wheel}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item When we employ the technique of generalization in design, what are we doing, and which part of OO design is closely related to this concept?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[] 
    \end{itemize}

    %DONE
    \item List two differences between the state transition diagram and the sequence diagram.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[] A state chart covers a larger span than the sequence diagram.
        \item[] A sequence diagram is designed to describe one particular function.    
    \end{enumerate}
   
    %DONE
    \item Describe three different views used in architectural design. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[] Logical views -- represents the relationship between classes (Object Oriented View)
        \item[] Process views -- represents the runtime components and how they interact with eachother
        \item[] Subsystem decomposition -- represents the modules and subsystems, joined with export and import relations
    \end{enumerate}

    %DONE
    \item What is the difference between data modeling and logical database design?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Data Modeling is creating an ER model, and Logical Database Design is taking in input as a detailed ER model and and producing a normalized, relational schema.
    \end{itemize}

    %DONE
    \item Describe the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping in the design of the interface. Choose one and give the reasons why you should show the client this prototype. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] I would show a high-fidelity prototype to the consumer, it is a more polished form instead of a hand-drawn design. I would use a low-fidelity model to base my high-fidelity model
        off of. I think it is more professional, if time allows, to present a basic interface so that the consumer has a better idea of what they are buying.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Explain the three columns in Figure 7.26 labeled User, Screen Output, and Process with regard to design. 

    %DONE
    \item Choose one of the cognitive models and explain how the model impacts the design of the user interface. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Norman developed a model in 1988 that was based on the psychology of everyday actions. He developed a model with 7 different stages. This impacts the design of the system because you
        need to know the \textit{goals} and \textit{expectations} of the users. You should then cater your design to the goals and expectations of the user. 
    \end{itemize}


    \item Visit a website that is from a different country or culture. Give an example of a multicultural 
    issue you found on their site. Explain how you would propose to redesign, taking into consideration the issue found.
