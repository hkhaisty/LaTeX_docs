\section*{Call to Action}
The object of this event is to bring people together, to introduce ideas and topics for research projects, and to raise awareness of the clubs and technologies available to students here at Kennesaw State University. 

\section*{The Plan}
The plan is to reserve a room here at KSU, have enough food for the projected number of attendants, and briefly describe what different projects are or could possibly be. We will have volunteers from different clubs at KSU man tables with different equipment available. 

\section*{The Speaker(s)}
I will speak at this event, give a brief introduction of the groups, and explain the idea behind this event. We may have other professors who are looking for research assistants speak if they wish to. 

\section*{The Food}
The projected number of attendants is around 50 students, if we host this in the Atrium Building.
